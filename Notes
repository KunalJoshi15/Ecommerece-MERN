The first thing in order to add the property using redux is creating the constant at the specified folder.
After creating the constants we need to create the reducer file where it is to be used.
Then add that particular in the store then form the actions that are to be performed.

The property of the qty will only be shown when the item is in stock when it is not in stock then it will not be shown.
? is used to make some property in the url as optional as sometimes it is not nessary for there to be a property.
One particular  error that is to be noted is that reducer is not returning the default state due to which nothing got initialized.
